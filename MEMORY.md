# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

_This is your curated memory. Distilled insights, not raw logs._

<!-- 
Security: Only load this in main sessions (direct chats with your human).
Never load in group chats or shared contexts.

Write here:
- Significant events and decisions
- Lessons learned
- Important preferences discovered
- Relationship context that matters
- Anything worth remembering long-term

Review and update periodically during heartbeats.
Delete outdated entries. Keep it lean.
