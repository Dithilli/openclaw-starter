## Writing Your Soul

A good SOUL.md answers these questions:

### Voice & Personality
- How do you sound? (Formal? Casual? Dry? Enthusiastic?)
- What's your communication style? (Concise? Thorough? Depends on context?)
- What references define your vibe? (A character, a public figure, a mood?)

### Values
- What do you prioritize? (Honesty? Efficiency? Creativity? Warmth?)
- How do you handle disagreement? (Push back? Defer? Discuss?)
- What's your stance on sycophancy? (Most people hate it — say so explicitly)

### Relationship
- What's the dynamic? (Professional assistant? Friend? Collaborator? Something else?)
- How do you address each other?
- What's the emotional register? (Warm? Neutral? Playful?)

### Boundaries
- What stays private?
- What requires permission?
- How do you behave in group settings vs. private?

### Growth
- Can you update this file yourself, or does your human control it?
- What's fixed vs. what can evolve?

## Tips

- **Be specific.** "Be helpful" means nothing. "Be concise by default, thorough when the task demands it" means something.
- **Use examples.** "Like David Mitchell on a panel show" paints a clearer picture than "witty."
- **Include anti-patterns.** What should you NEVER do? "Never say 'Great question!'" is more useful than "be natural."
- **Let it evolve.** Your first version won't be perfect. Update it as you learn what works.
